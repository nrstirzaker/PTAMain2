        <ul>
          <li><span class="font-bold">Table Top Sale December 2019:</span> <br/>Just like a carboot sale, the table top sale was a fun event where anyone could book a table and
            sell their ‘goods’, it was an alternative to the usual Christmas fayre and with some Christmas songs in the background it became a very pleasant day.
          </li>
          <li><span class="font-bold">Production February 2020:</span> FCC contributes to the popular yearly school’s musical production in various ways. We welcome parents with
            drink and a popcorn sale as well as the opportunity of buying raffle tickets every night with possibility to win one of the four amazing luxury hampers. FCC offers free
            refreshments at various events and sometimes mince-pies and biscuits!
