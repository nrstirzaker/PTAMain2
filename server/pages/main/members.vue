            Hi, my name is <span class="font-bold">Nigel</span> Stirzaker, I am the current chair of FCC, the PTA of Christ’s College. I volunteer because I want to raise funds
            to give our children more opportunities than I had growing up in the 70s and 80s. I want them to be able to fly higher and further than we have. Having a home, owned or
            rented, is a struggle these days as the world and work gets more and more competitive. The PTA’s role is to generate money for activities and items that will enhance
            our children’s all-round education, not necessarily academic but more soft-skills which are essential to get along in the today’s work environments.
            In the past, we have raised money to part-fund internet safety workshops, hire coaches to take year groups to a career fairs and most recently we have bought the
            school’s brand-new football kit. All public schools are short of money, resources, staff and have to work within complex bureaucratic frameworks that our successive
            governments have designed in an effort to improve things. As a PTA we try and identify needs and provide funds to meet those needs. So, why am I a part of the PTA?
            Because it allows me to play a part
            in making things better.

            My name is <span class="font-bold">Sarah</span> Hedger-Howe, I am Treasurer for Friends of Christ’s College. I have a son who started in Christ’s College in September
            2018 and I have a younger son
            who started in 2020.
            I joined the Christ’s College Committee in 2019 as I have a passion for supporting schools where there is a greater need for fundraising and parent support. Currently
            there are 6 parent members on the Committee. We always encourage more parents to join our friendly team. I have been on the Committee for Weyfield Primary Academy
            School for several years so have a lot of fundraising experience. For a Secondary School it is harder to raise money, because as parents we are far more removed, but
            our small team tries to engage with parents and students to help make the Friends of Christ’s College be a real part of the school community.
            I come from a PA background so have a lot of experience in organisation and administration, but my key asset is being a people person, so please don’t hesitate to speak
            to me if you feel you would like to join the team or help in anyway as I am very approachable!
            You will find me at most 2nd Hand Uniform sales too where I help Sandra Philips of our team.

            Hi my name is <span class="font-bold">Margareth</span> Mayersbeth, I have two children at Christ’s College, one started in September 2017 and another in 2019. I have
            helped FCC since November 2019
            and it has been really great to meet at Worplesdon Place with the FCC team to come up with ideas for building up our school’s community and to raise funds. I have taken
            on the role of secretarial duties for FCC. I have recently become an exam invigilator and volunteer at the school’s library regularly during the day. Fortnightly I
            enjoy attending Parents Prayer in the Chapel to pray for our school too. I have been a class representative in my children’s primary school and enjoy getting together
            building up the school’s community. Nigel and I knew each other from Ripley Primary School, a local school which had to go through closure. It was a painful process and
            this made me realize even more how important parental input, community, fundraising and positivity is for a school, no matter what size the school is.

            Hi my name is <span class="font-bold">Sandra</span> Philips. I have 2 boys at Christ’s College. One started in 2017 and the other it 2019. I have been involved in FCC
            since 2018. I help run the 2nd hand uniform sales along with Sarah and I help at events like the summer festival serving refreshments etc. I was also involved in my
            boy’s previous school’s PTA too.
            Having been involved in both I can definitely say that there is less pressure in a secondary school’s PTA.

            I joined the school in September 2000, so have been part of this community for 20yrs now. During that time I have been a full time teacher, head of department and now a
            member of the leadership team. I have had several roles and responsibilities on the leadership team but one of my favourite things has been as the CLT link for Friends
            of Christ’s College. I joined in 2012 having been asked by Mr Green to link FCC with the 6th Form. Little did I know the impact it would have on me.
            I serve as a point of contact and help for FCC. Offering the college point of view or answering questions. I help with getting the student body to work with FCC and
            between us we all work out what the staff or students need and I liaise with FCC to see how they can help.
            Over the years FCC has raised so much money for the school and they have had a huge impact on education and students at the college. I get to see first hand the good
            that they do for the students here and it is amazing how supportive they have been. From rewards schemes to lunchtime benches to 2nd hand uniform and internet safety
            training...FCC fundraising events have provided a broad range of things that add value to the college.
            Working with FCC has been a real pleasure and a privilege. It never seems like work to me, we have a lot of fun at our regular meets. They are informal but focussed. I
            get to discuss school with parents and I learn a lot about the parents point of view. Often taking this information back to Mrs Hatch and the leadership team so we can
            make improvements or change perceptions. FCC remains a really important part of the school and I could not recommend it highly enough.

            Hi My name is <span class="font-bold">Zed</span> Annan and I have worked at Christ's College for almost 4 years.
            I am the Student Development Lead which incorporates lots of different aspects of the school, including leading on careers and mental health & Wellbeing. I am also a
            part of the safeguarding team.
            Having only recently joined the FCC I can honestly say how welcoming they all are. The sense of community is one of the many things that makes me love working at CCG
            and the FCC are always supportive and wanting to do the best for the school. It Is always great to have new people join!
            Look forward to seeing some new faces at our monthly meetings!

            Hello I'm <span class="font-bold">Sylvia</span> Owen I have a child in year 7. I work with adults with a learning disabilities part-time and so I've always
            been involved in helping Stoughton
            and Northmead schools through helping at functions:school fairs, Christmas fairs and also in school with listening to children read. I feel it's so important to know
            that your child knows you're involved in their lives and also get to know teachers and have fun. With Christ's College I hope that I can contribute in a small way and
            good to feel involved in aspects of school life even through the pandemic way of working. Sylvia Owen
